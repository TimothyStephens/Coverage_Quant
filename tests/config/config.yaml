# Path to fasta file with all MAG scaffolds combined together.
# reference name : absolute path (can be gzipped)
ref_path:
  'Combined': 'tests/data/combined_MAGs.fa'

# Path to tab-delimited text file listing the MAG_id (1st col) and sequence names of the scaffolds in each MAG (2nd col) - One line per sequence name.
# MAG1 [tab] seq1
# MAG1 [tab] seq2
# ...
# All listed sequence names must be in 'ref_path' but not all sequences in 'ref_path' need to be in 'g2s_path'
# So, you can include contamination or decoy sequences in 'ref_path' and exclude them from 'g2s_path' to have CoverM calculate stats from just your target MAGs in 'g2s_path'.
